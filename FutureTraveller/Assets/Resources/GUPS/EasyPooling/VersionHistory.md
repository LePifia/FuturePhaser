# Version History:

## 2024.1.1: Delayed Despawns
- Improvement: Adjusted the spawn behaviour in the demos a little bit.
- Feature: A delayed despawn method for pools has been added. Calling the method starts a coroutine that waits x seconds and then performs the despawning. Useful when despawning a large number of game objects to delay the despawn and reduce garbage collecting.

## 2024.1: First official release of EasyPooling.
